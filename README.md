## Slides and Code Examples from Doodling with the Canvas API
#### A talk given at the 2019 Nerd Summit

This Git repository contains a [REVEAL.JS](https://revealjs.com/#/) slide deck for
a talk called "Doodling with the Canvas API" given at the
[2019 Nerd Summit](https://nerdsummit.org/) at [UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/).

The presentation is available for viewing on the The github pages
here â†’ https://knowuh.github.io/2019-nerd-doodle/#/

The goal of the talk is to inspire people to doodle more, and stress less. It
comes from my experience teaching software design principles to graphic designers.
I hope you enjoy it.
